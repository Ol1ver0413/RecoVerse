# RecoVerse ðŸŒŒ â€” A Multi-Agent Recommendation System

**RecoVerse** is an intelligent, modular, and extensible multi-agent recommendation system. It leverages the power of collaborative agents to deliver personalized, explainable, and adaptive recommendations across domains.

## ðŸš€ Overview

RecoVerse transforms traditional recommendation pipelines by introducing **Multi-Agent Collaboration**, where each agent is responsible for a specific cognitive task â€” from understanding user intent to reasoning over historical data and generating tailored suggestions.

### âœ¨ Key Features

- ðŸ¤– **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Decentralized agents handle user modeling, content analysis, filtering, ranking, and explanation tasks.
- ðŸ§  **Intent-Aware**: Agents jointly infer both explicit and *implicit* user needs based on behavior, preferences, and feedback.
- ðŸ”„ **Pluggable Workflows**: Easily extend or replace agents for domain-specific customization.
- ðŸ“Š **Hybrid Recommendations**: Supports collaborative filtering, content-based methods, and rule-augmented heuristics.
